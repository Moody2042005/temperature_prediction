# Colorful Gradient Background Animation

## Project Overview
This project creates a smooth, animated gradient background effect for webpages using pure CSS. The animation transitions seamlessly between multiple vibrant colors, creating an eye-catching visual effect. You can easily customize the colors, animation speed, and gradient angle to match your design needs.

## Project Features
- Smooth color transitions between multiple gradient stops
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Lightweight implementation using only HTML and CSS
- Easy customization options for colors and animation

## Project Implementation

### File Overview
- `index.html` - Contains the basic HTML structure
- `style.css` - Implements the gradient animation effect

### How It Works
1. The CSS creates a linear gradient with multiple color stops
2. The background size is enlarged to enable smooth animation
3. A CSS keyframe animation shifts the background position
4. The animation loops infinitely for a continuous effect

## Customization Options
You can easily modify the effect by:
1. Changing the gradient colors in `style.css`
2. Adjusting the animation duration (currently 20s)
3. Modifying the gradient angle (currently 45 degrees)
4. Changing the animation timing function

## Prerequisites
To use or modify this project, you should understand:
- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling and selectors
- CSS animations and keyframes
- Color values (hex codes)

## Local Setup
### Installation
No installation required! Just:
1. Download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

### Supported Browsers
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Other modern browsers

## Usage
Simply include these files in your project:
1. Add the CSS to your stylesheet
2. Apply the animation class to any element
3. Customize the colors to match your brand
