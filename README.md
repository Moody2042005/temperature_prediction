# Temperature Prediction Project

Predict tomorrow's temperature using historical weather data with machine learning.

## Overview

In this project, we predict tomorrow's temperature using historical weather data. The workflow includes:
- Downloading and cleaning local weather data
- Preparing data for machine learning
- Building a prediction system
- Improving model accuracy
- Making next-day temperature predictions

## Project Steps

1. **Download weather data** from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
2. **Clean and visualize** the weather data
3. **Create a testing framework** for historical predictions
4. **Improve model accuracy** by adding more predictors
5. **Implement next-day prediction** functionality

## Code

The main project code is in:
- `predict.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the temperature prediction implementation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, you should be familiar with:
- Python fundamentals (functions, conditionals, data structures)
- Data cleaning techniques
- Pandas and NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- Machine learning basics

## Local Setup

### Installation

1. Install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)
2. Python 3.8 or newer
3. Required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
